* Factorization problem: find the smallest P such that P*Q=N
* P is a 3 bits number (x3 x2 x1)
* Q is a 3 bits number (x6 x5 x4)
* N=35
* 
* minimize the value of P
min: +1 x1 +2 x2 +4 x3 ;
* P>=2 (to avoid trivial factorization)
+1 x1 +2 x2 +4 x3 >=2;
* Q>=2 (to avoid trivial factorization)
+1 x4 +2 x5 +4 x6 >=2;
